## Content

- Problem
- Goal
- Trials and errors
- Best solution so far
- Lessons learned

## Problem

- Audience with different background
- Different skills
- Different data
- There is no one-size-fits-all solution

## Goal

- Enable students to quickly reproduce and apply data-visualization techniques.
- Help students efficiently learn and reproduce practical data-visualization workflows.
- Teach reproducible, practical data-visualization skills so students can focus on technique.


<!-- Computational reproducibility means that research results obtained through computation can be consistently `re-produced` by others  given the same inputs and methods.  -->



## The Pillars of computational reproducibility

- Code
- Data
- `Environment`
- Documentation
- Workflows

## Spectrum of reproducibility

## Capturing Computational Envionments

## First: docker containers

## Pre-built environments

- Jupyter stacks
- Rocker

## Barriers to Container Adoption

- Difficulties using the terminal
- Not enough time to teach `container management`
- Not enough `storage space` on their laptops
- Not enough permissions on their machine
- Computer setup language (Chinese)
- Too many processed running simultaneously

## Second: Binder

- Launches Jupyter notebooks in the cloud
- No local install needed
- Share reproducible environments
- Great for teaching and demos
- Free, but limited resources

## How Binder works

:::

## Main Barriers running binder

- Starting the environment can be slow
- Few resources (2 GB in RAM)
- No persistent storage

## Third: HPC (Habrok)


 - `10,000` + CPU cores
 - 100+ compute nodes
 - High-speed InfiniBand network
 - Large memory nodes for demanding tasks
 - GPU nodes for accelerated computing
 - Petabytes of storage
 - Shared for research and education


## Challenges using HPC

- Terminal can be challenging
  - File management
- Port-forwarding
  - SSH tunnel
- Loging into the HPC cluster

## Fourth: self hosted Binder

- Small cluster (17 cores)
- Limited memory (2 GB)
- 5G persistent storage


## Challenges

- Maintenance
- Limited resources
  - Human
  - Hardware

## Fifth: GitHub Codespaces

- Cloud-based development environments
- Run `VS Code` and `JupyterLab` in your browser
- Pre-configured for your project
- No local setup needed
- Code, build, and test from anywhere
- Great for collaboration and reproducibility

## Codespaces

## Assignments

## GitHub Education: From Classroom to Codespaces

- Teachers join GitHub Education for `free resources`
- Set up a Classroom to manage assignments
- Use official or custom templates for student projects
- Students accept assignments, get their own repo
- Codespaces launches a ready-to-code environment for each student
- Teachers track progress, review code, and give feedback
- Streamlines reproducible, collaborative learning

## Are GitHub codespaces good enough?

- Are good, but not enough
- Serve the Data Visualization env via an HPC GUI


## Lessons learned

- The learning curve is high but `benefits are remarkable`
- Containerization plays an important role creating the environments
- `Always prepare an alternative`
- There is no system `100%` stable


## Git failures

## Benefits of Computational Reproducibility

1. Integrity and Trust
2. `Efficiency and Reuse`
3. Collaboration and Transparency
4. `Long-term` Preservation
5. Scalability and Generalization
6. Policy and Funding Compliance
