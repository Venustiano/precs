## Content

- Problem
- Goal
- Trials and errors
- Best solution so far
- Lessons learned

## Problem

- Audience with different background
- Different skills
- Different data
- There is no one-size-fits-all solution

## Goal

- Enable students to quickly reproduce and apply data-visualization techniques.
- Help students efficiently learn and reproduce practical data-visualization workflows.
- Teach reproducible, practical data-visualization skills so students can focus on technique.


<!-- Computational reproducibility means that research results obtained through computation can be consistently `re-produced` by others  given the same inputs and methods.  -->



## The Pillars of computational reproducibility

- Code
- Data
- `Environment`
- Documentation
- Workflows

## Spectrum of reproducibility

## Capturing Computational Envionments

## First: docker containers

## Pre-built environments

- Jupyter stacks
- Rocker

## Barriers to Container Adoption

- Difficulties using the terminal
- Not enough time to teach `container management`
- Not enough `storage space` on their laptops
- Not enough permissions on their machine
- Computer setup language (Chinese)
- Too many processed running simultaneously

## Second: Binder

- Launches Jupyter notebooks in the cloud
- No local install needed
- Share reproducible environments
- Great for teaching and demos
- Free, but limited resources

## How Binder works

::: center
![](/images/binder-comic.png){ width=800px fig-align="center" target="https://book.the-turing-way.org/communication/binder/"}
:::

## Main Barriers running binder

- Starting the environment can be slow
- A few resources (2 GB in RAM)
- No persistent storage
- 

## Third: HPC (Habrok)


 - `10,000` + CPU cores
 - 100+ compute nodes
 - High-speed InfiniBand network
 - Large memory nodes for demanding tasks
 - GPU nodes for accelerated computing
 - Petabytes of storage
 - Shared for research and education


## Challenges using HPC

- Terminal can be challenging
  - File management
- Port-forwarding
  - SSH tunnel
- Loging into the HPC cluster

## Fourth: self hosted Binder

- Small cluster (17 cores)
- Limited memory (2 GB)
- 5G persistent storage


## Challenges

- Maintenance
- Limited resources
  - Human
  - Hardware

## Fifth: GitHub Codespaces

- Cloud-based development environments
- Run `VS Code` and `JupyterLab` in your browser
- Pre-configured for your project
- No local setup needed
- Code, build, and test from anywhere
- Great for collaboration and reproducibility

## Codespaces

## Assignments

## GitHub Education: From Classroom to Codespaces

- Teachers join GitHub Education for free resources
- Set up a Classroom to manage assignments
- Use official or custom templates for student projects
- Students accept assignments, get their own repo
- Codespaces launches a ready-to-code environment for each student
- Teachers track progress, review code, and give feedback
- Streamlines reproducible, collaborative learning

## Lessons learned
- The learning curve is high but benefits are good
- Container play an important role creating the environments

## Why use Codespaces for teaching reproducibility?

- Removes barriers related to hardware, permissions, and setup
- Saves time for instructors and students
- Facilitates reproducible workflows and collaborative learning

<!-- ## The Challenges

- Software rot
- Data availability
- Complexity
- Human factors -->

## Benefits of Computational Reproducibility

1. Integrity and Trust
2. `Efficiency and Reuse`
3. Collaboration and Transparency
4. `Long-term` Preservation
5. Scalability and Generalization
6. Policy and Funding Compliance





## Tools for Computational Reproducibility {.smaller}

- Version control
- Virtualization
  - `Containers`
  - Virtual machines
  - Package managers
- Data repositories
- Notebooks and literate programming
- Community standards





## Why docker containers?

CON:

`Costs time`

PRO:

`Can save you time`

## Application of Containers

Containers are widely used in:

- Software deployment and scaling
- Reproducible research environments
- Continuous integration and testing
- Cloud computing and microservices
- Data science workflows

## Containers and Dependency Hell

Containers solve "dependency hell" by isolating software and its dependencies, preventing conflicts between packages and versions. This makes environments reproducible and easier to manage across systems.



## R Example

<!-- ```{r}
#| echo: true
library(ggplot2)

# Create sample data
data <- data.frame(
  x = 1:10,
  y = rnorm(10)
)

# Create plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1) +
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Random Data Plot", x = "Index", y = "Value")
``` -->

## R Data Summary

<!-- ```{r}
#| echo: true
# Create sample dataset
iris_summary <- iris |>
  subset(Species == "setosa") |>
  summary()

print(iris_summary)
``` -->

## Mixed Workflow

You can use both languages in the same presentation:

1. Load data in R
2. Analyze it with Python
3. Visualize with either language

This flexibility makes Quarto ideal for data science presentations!

## Getting Started

To render this presentation:

```bash
quarto render example-presentation.qmd
```

Or to preview with live reload:

```bash
quarto preview example-presentation.qmd
```
