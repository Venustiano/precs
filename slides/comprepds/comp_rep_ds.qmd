## Content

- Problem
- Goal
- Trials and errors
- Best solution so far

## Problem

- Audience with different background
- Different skills
- Different data
- There is no one-size-fits-all solution

## Goal

- Enable students to quickly reproduce and apply data-visualization techniques.
- Help students efficiently learn and reproduce practical data-visualization workflows.
- Teach reproducible, practical data-visualization skills so students can focus on technique.


<!-- Computational reproducibility means that research results obtained through computation can be consistently `re-produced` by others  given the same inputs and methods.  -->



## The Pillars of computational reproducibility

- Code
- Data
- `Environment`
- Documentation
- Workflows

## First attempt (docker containers)

## Second attempt (Binder)

## Third attempt (HPC)

## Fourth attempt (Public and Locally hosted Binder)

## Github Codespaces



<!-- ## The Challenges

- Software rot
- Data availability
- Complexity
- Human factors -->

## Benefits of Computational Reproducibility

1. Integrity and Trust
2. `Efficiency and Reuse`
3. Collaboration and Transparency
4. `Long-term` Preservation
5. Scalability and Generalization
6. Policy and Funding Compliance





## Tools for Computational Reproducibility {.smaller}

- Version control
- Virtualization
  - `Containers`
  - Virtual machines
  - Package managers
- Data repositories
- Notebooks and literate programming
- Community standards





## Why docker containers?

CON:

`Costs time`

PRO:

`Can save you time`

## Application of Containers

Containers are widely used in:

- Software deployment and scaling
- Reproducible research environments
- Continuous integration and testing
- Cloud computing and microservices
- Data science workflows

## Containers and Dependency Hell

Containers solve "dependency hell" by isolating software and its dependencies, preventing conflicts between packages and versions. This makes environments reproducible and easier to manage across systems.



## R Example

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(ggplot2)

# Create sample data
data <- data.frame(
  x = 1:10,
  y = rnorm(10)
)

# Create plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1) +
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Random Data Plot", x = "Index", y = "Value")
```

## R Data Summary

```{r}
#| echo: true
# Create sample dataset
iris_summary <- iris |>
  subset(Species == "setosa") |>
  summary()

print(iris_summary)
```

## Mixed Workflow

You can use both languages in the same presentation:

1. Load data in R
2. Analyze it with Python
3. Visualize with either language

This flexibility makes Quarto ideal for data science presentations!

## Getting Started

To render this presentation:

```bash
quarto render example-presentation.qmd
```

Or to preview with live reload:

```bash
quarto preview example-presentation.qmd
```

## Thank You!
